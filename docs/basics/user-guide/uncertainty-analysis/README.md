# Uncertainty Analysis

After defining sensitivities, one can assess how a change in the parameter affects the functional. Still, one has to provide covariances to define the magnitude of a perturbation. The interaction with covariances is provided via the $$\texttt{Covariance}$$ module, and an uncertainty propagation is conducted via the $$\texttt{Analysis}$$ module.
