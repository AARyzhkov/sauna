# Welcome

This package has been developed for conducting seamless systematic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis with respect to nuclear data. It provides capabilities from producing covariance nuclear data to propagating the uncertainties and finding target accuracy requirements (TARs) for nuclear data to satisfy TARs for reactor functionals (responses). SAUNA allows one to systematically analyze nuclear data influence on functionals leveraging Python capabilities.
